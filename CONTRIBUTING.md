# Contributing to OpenScribe

Thanks for your interest in contributing to OpenScribe.

OpenScribe is an MIT-licensed, local-first, open-source AI medical scribe.
The goal is to provide transparent, auditable infrastructure rather than a
closed SaaS product.

## Project Philosophy

- Local-first by default
- Explicit data boundaries
- No telemetry or analytics
- Provider-agnostic, modular design
- AI output is always a draft requiring human review

## Ways to Contribute

You do NOT need clinical experience to contribute.

High-priority contribution areas:
- Error handling and edge cases
- Test coverage (unit + integration)
- Documentation and developer onboarding
- Accessibility and UX improvements
- LLM provider adapters
- Transcription backend adapters
- Pipeline evaluation and validation

## Code Standards

- TypeScript with explicit types
- No implicit `any`
- Prefer small, composable modules
- Follow existing folder structure
- Avoid introducing analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Write tests for new functionality

## Project Structure

- `apps/web/` – Next.js frontend + API routes
- `packages/pipeline/` – Audio ingest, transcription, assembly, evaluation
- `packages/ui/` – Shared React components
- `packages/storage/` – Encrypted storage + encounter management
- `packages/llm/` – Provider-agnostic LLM client
- `packages/shell/` – Electron main process
- `config/` – Shared configuration files

See [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Place tests in `__tests__` directories or `*.test.ts` files
- Use the Node.js built-in test runner
- Mock external API calls in unit tests
- Include both success and error cases

## Staying Updated

Keep your fork in sync with the main repository:

```bash
git pull origin main  # Pull latest changes
pnpm install          # Update dependencies

# If you encounter issues after updating:
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install
```
